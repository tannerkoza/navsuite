## üöÄ Our Mission <a name = "our-mission"></a>

***navsuite*** was created to provide a centralized repository for Python tools that help facilitate positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) research and development. This project combines a collection of previously created packages (and any future packages) into one project to allow for easy dependency management and quick feature additions.

- **NOTE:** We are still very early in development as features are being added on an "as-needed" basis. Feel free to request new features in an [issue](https://github.com/tannerkoza/navsuite/issues/new) or refer to the [contributing instructions](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for adding your own features to merge in a [pull request](https://github.com/tannerkoza/navsuite/pulls).

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting-started"></a>

### Prerequisites

Python **3.10-3.12** are currently supported and tested against using the [`<ubuntu-windows-mac>-latest`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources) operating system runners supported by GitHub Actions.

### Installing ***navsuite*** Packages

Currently, there are no stable releases of any package included in ***navsuite***. Therefore, there are no wheels readily available for download from any package index repository. However, each package can still be installed using the following command prototype:

```sh
pip install "git+https://github.com/tannerkoza/navsuite.git#egg=<package>&subdirectory=src/<package>"
```
In this command, `<package>` can simply be replaced by one of the package names in the `src/` directory (e.g., `navtools`). Additionally, these packages can be installed with any [PEP 517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/) compatible build system (in addition to `pip`) and their alternative to the above command.

### Recommendations
- Given the adherence to PEP 517, the editable install command for your respective build system *should* work for each ***navsuite*** package. However, it is recommended to use [rye](https://rye.astral.sh/) in accordance with the [contributing instructions](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the best editable install experience.
- As always, it is recommended you install these packages to a virtual environment. How that virtual environment is generated is completely up to you.
